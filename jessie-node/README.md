# Jessie-Node

This is a simple Docker file for a node container for your PI. It will download and install node-v7.9.0 for ARM.
To use NPM and Node, you need to run your commands as SUDO. I'm aware of the issue with doing so, and looking at how to fix it.

This image is mostly based off the work by [Alexellis](https://github.com/alexellis/docker-arm), I've just made a few tweaks.
